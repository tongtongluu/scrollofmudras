                        Mudra, in Buddhism and Hinduism art, a symbolic gesture of the hands and fingers used either in sculptures and paintings. Together with four basic postures - reclining, standing, walking, and sitting, mudras tend to be numerous and complicated. Let's
                        explore those numerous messages!

                    By studying the sources of these artworks, we found that China is the largest source, followed by Japan and India and other countries with relatively deep Buddhist traditions. There is not enough evidence to show that the preference for mudras in Buddhist
                    art has regional characteristics. Although we see obvious groups in the Smithsonian collection, more data samples are needed.

                    This time only part of the mudra collections are included in this data visualizaiton project. But the actual mudra collections are much more than the 177 cases come after keyword searching. I believe that the current results can give a glimpse of the mudra collection.At the same time, I also saw the possibility of continuous research on Mudra.
